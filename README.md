# WebGL_LightingOnAnimal

The objective of this project was to better understand how lighting works in computer graphics. Using spheres helps visualize the light as apossed to cubes or flat surfaces. So, I included an animal in the center that faces towards the light. <br> <br>

I included an ON and OFF switch to better visualize the lighting on the objects surfaces. <br>
The light on the surfaces are creating using the Phong Shader Model
